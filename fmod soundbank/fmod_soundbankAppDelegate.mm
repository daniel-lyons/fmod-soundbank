//	Project:	FMOD_SOUNDBANK
//  File:		fmod_soundbankAppDelegate.m
//  Created by: Chris Latham of EngineAudio.com
//
//	Description: This application runs in the iPhone Simulator to test the FMOD audio engine created by Firelight Technologies
//	The application uses .FEV and .FSB files generated out of the FMOD Designer to laod and play audio then manipulate it real time.
//	The application is made up of two main screens the first allows the user to choose a sound from the FMOD soundbank using a UIPicker, with two sliders to adjust real time parameters.
//	The second screen is used like a X/Y touch controller (similar to a Korg Kaoss pad) to play a sound when touched and adjust two real time parameters along the X and Y axis.
//	To use custom soundbanks replace any .FEV or .FSB files in the Resources folder with custom files generated from "Build project..." in the FMOD Designer
